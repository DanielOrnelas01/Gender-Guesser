# Gender Guesser

# Purpose
To have a user be able to search any first name to have the server guess if they are male or female.
* When a user enters their first name, they receive a response with their gender and the percentage their name is either male or female.
* When a user clicks the button for a joke, they receive a randomized Chuck Norris joke.
* The users name is stored in local storage.
* There is a clear button to empty the local storage should the user choose.
* The bottom of the page has links to a name generator and the most popular names for the last 100 years for reference on generating name percentages.
* The bottom of the page has a link to Chuck Norris's Wikipedia and Official Website.
